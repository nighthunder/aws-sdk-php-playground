# Amazon DynamoDB code examples for the SDK for PHP (v3)

## Purpose

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for PHP (v3) to get started using operations in Amazon DynamoDB. Learn to create tables, add
items, update data, create custom queries, and delete tables and items.

*Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless
scalability.*

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. 
At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. 
For more information, see 
[Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. 
For more information, see 
[AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

  (`executeStatement - INSERT`)
* [Get an item in a table with PartiQL - BatchExecuteStatement](partiql_basics/GettingStartedWithPartiQLBatch.php)
  (`executeStatement - SELECT`)
* [Update an item in a table with PartiQL - BatchExecuteStatement](partiql_basics/GettingStartedWithPartiQLBatch.php)
  (`executeStatement - UPDATE`)
* [Delete an item in a table with PartiQL - BatchExecuteStatement](partiql_basics/GettingStartedWithPartiQLBatch.php)
  (`executeStatement - DELETE`)

### Scenario examples

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* [Getting started with DynamoDB](dynamodb_basics/GettingStartedWithDynamoDB.php)
* [Getting started with DynamoDB and PartiQL](dynamodb_basics/GettingStartedWithPartiQL.php)
* [Getting started with PartiQL batching](dynamodb_basics/GettingStartedWithPartiQLBatch.php)

## Running the examples
**Getting started with DynamoDB**

This scenario shows you how to create an Amazon DynamoDB table for storing movie data. The scenario loads movies into
the table from a JSON-formatted file and walks you through an interactive demo to add, update, and delete movies one at
a time. The scenario also shows you how to query for sets of movies.

```
composer install
```

After your composer dependencies are installed, you can run the interactive getting started file directly with the
following from the `aws-doc-sdk-examples\php\dynamodb\dynamodb_basics` directory:

```
php Runner.php
```   

Alternatively, you can have the choices automatically selected by running the file as part of a PHPUnit test with the
following:

```
..\..\vendor\bin\phpunit DynamoDBBasicsTests.php
```

**Getting started with DynamoDB and PartiQL**

This scenario shows you how to create an Amazon DynamoDB table for storing movie data. The scenario loads movies into
the table from a JSON-formatted file and walks you through an interactive demo to add, update, and delete movies by 
using PartiQL (both with `executeStatement` and `batchExecuteStatement`).

Run the following from the `aws-doc-sdk-examples\php\dynamodb\partiql_basics` directory:

```
composer install
```

After your composer dependencies are installed, you can run the interactive getting started file directly with the
following:

```
php Runner.php
```   

Alternatively, you can have the choices automatically selected by running the file as part of a PHPUnit test with the
following:

```
..\..\vendor\bin\phpunit PartiQLBasicsTests.php
```

*Note: `batchExecuteStatement` examples are found in `GettingStartedWithPartiQLBatch.php`. To run this example with 
`Runner.php`, edit the file and change all instances of `GettingStartedWithPartiQL` to `GettingStartedWithPartiQLBatch`.

### Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region configured as described in
the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and Credentials Reference Guide]
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
- PHP 7.1 or later.
- Composer installed.
